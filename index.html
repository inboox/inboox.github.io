											<h2>What is inboox?</h2>
										</header>
										<p>Inboox is a book club.
											We'll read 4 books a year, all recipients of a major literary award.
											There will also be the option to discuss the book online.
											If you would like, I can send you the books too!
											<br><br>

											Given the socially distant times, I thought this could help provide a little community! </p>

									<h2>The Four Pillars</h2>
								</header>
									<p> The four books we read annually come from the following four categories:
									</p>
								<ul class="features">
									<li>
										<span class="icon solid major style5 fa-star"></span>   <!--fa-flag-usa-->
										<h3>The Pulitzer Prize</h3>
										<p>The <a href="https://www.pulitzer.org/prize-winners-by-category/219">Pulitzer Prize in Fiction</a> is awarded for distinguished fiction published in book form during the year by an American author,
											preferably dealing with American life. It was first awarded in 1918. </p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<span class="icon solid major style1 fa-circle"></span>
										<h3>芥川賞</h3>
										<p>The <a href="https://www.bunshun.co.jp/shinkoukai/award/index.html">Akutagawa Prize</a> is a Japanese literary prize awarded semiannually for the best work of fiction by a promising new Japanese writer.
											Novellas win the prize more frequently than do full-length novels. First awarded in 1935.</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<span class="icon major solid style3 fa-chess-rook"></span>
										<h3>Premio Miguel de Cervantes</h3>
										<p>The <a href="http://www.culturaydeporte.gob.es/cultura/areas/libro/mc/premios-cervantes-40/presentacion.html">Miguel de Cervantes Prize </a> is a literary award established in 1975 by the Spanish Ministry of Culture.
											The Cervantes Prize is presented to an author whose Castilian-language work as a whole is judged to have most enriched Spanish and Spanish-American culture. </p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<span class="icon major solid style2 fa-dice-three"></span>
										<h3> Grab Bag </h3>
										<p>This last one is an individual choice between three:
											<br>
											<br>
											<a href="https://pen.org/pen-eo-wilson-prize-literary-science-writing/">PEN/E.O. Wilson Literary Science Writing Award</a><br><br>
											<a href="https://nebulas.sfwa.org/about-the-nebulas/">Nebula Award for Best SF/Fantasy Novel</a><br><br>

									<h2>FAQ</h2>

									<button class="accordion"><p>&ensp;Why four books?&ensp;<p></button>
										<div class="panel">
  										<br>A book every 3 months gives everyone the chance to find time to read. We could read more books, but I don't want it to feel like work.
									</div>

									<br>
									<br>

									<button class="accordion"><p>&ensp;Why those categories?&ensp;<p></button>
										<div class="panel">
											<br>I like reading fiction and have spent a lot of time in the US, Japan, and Spain. As for that final category, it represents my tendancy to "mix things up." I am interested in science, I regularly attempt cooking, and have a special place in my heart for sci-fi.
									</div>

									<br>
									<br>

									<button class="accordion"><p>&ensp;Why do you need to send them? Can't I just buy the book?&ensp;<p></button>
										<div class="panel">
											<br>You can! But if I send out an email saying we're going to read a specific book, half of you will forget to buy it. (I knonw I would.) This way everything happens automatically and you just open the book and start. Plus, you know you like getting packages.
									</div>

									<button class="accordion"><p>&ensp;Why have a discussion on reddit?&ensp;<p></button>
										<div class="panel">
										 <br>Coordinating schedules and doing a Zoom conference is hard and stressful. A text-based platform like reddit is open for a few days and gives everyone the chance to participate. The commenting system on reddit is also perfect for responding to other people.

																		<br>
																		<br>

									<button class="accordion"><p>&ensp;What do I post about?&ensp;<p></button>
										<div class="panel">
											<br>You can write about whatever you want! A small paragraph about whether or not you liked the book. Your thoughts on the themes, characters, or literary devices used in the book. You can respond to other peoples comments, support their point, or (politely) disagree.

										<div class="panel">
											<br>I will send you 12 per year; 3 per quarter. You'll receive an introductory email on the first day of the quarter explaining the book and giving some context and info about the author. Then, 2.5 months later, you'll send a "Slacker Alert" email reminding you that the discussion is coming up in two weeks time. Finally, on the last weekend of the quarter when the discussion goes live, you'll get one reminder email.
